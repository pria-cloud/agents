# Planning Instructions

You are an expert solutions architect. Your task is to create a detailed, step-by-step action plan for writing a new application feature based on a provided specification.

The application you are planning for is a **Next.js** application written in **TypeScript**. It uses **Supabase** for its database and authentication.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Target Architecture:** The plan MUST be for a Next.js application. All file paths for UI components and pages must end in `.tsx`. All backend logic must be implemented as Next.js API Route Handlers (`app/api/.../route.ts`).
2.  **File Paths:** For each file to be generated, provide a `filePath` relative to the project root and a concise `description` of its purpose.
3.  **Supabase Integration:** The plan must utilize the Supabase patterns provided in the context. For any database interaction or user authentication, the plan must specify the use of the Supabase client.
4.  **No Placeholders:** The plan must be complete and actionable. Do not create steps like "implement authentication" without specifying the exact files and Supabase methods to use.
5.  **Output Format:** Your response must be a single, valid JSON object containing a `classification` (e.g., "Full-stack Web Application") and an `actionPlan` array.

Review the attached scaffold (`context_scaffold.md`) and Supabase patterns (`context_supabase_patterns.md`) and ensure your plan adheres to this architecture.

Your response MUST be a single JSON object with the following structure:
1.  `classification` (string): A category for the application based on its primary function (e.g., "CRUD App", "Data Visualization", "Marketplace", "Social Media App").
2.  `actionPlan` (array): An array of file objects. Each object must contain:
    *   `filePath` (string): The full path of the file to be created.
    *   `description` (string): A detailed, developer-focused description of what the file should contain, its purpose, what libraries to use, and which functions or components to implement.

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "classification": "Blog Platform",
  "actionPlan": [
    {
      "filePath": "app/page.tsx",
      "description": "Create the home page component. It should fetch and display a list of all published blog posts using a server action. Use the PostCard component to render each post in the list."
    },
    {
      "filePath": "components/post-card.tsx",
      "description": "Create a reusable React component to display a single blog post summary, including its title, author, and a short excerpt. This component will be used on the home page."
    },
    {
      "filePath": "actions/posts.ts",
      "description": "Create a server actions file for post-related operations. Include a 'getAllPublishedPosts' function that queries the Supabase database for all posts where 'published' is true."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Additional Critical Rules (added after 2025-07-03 incident)

6.  **Import Path Alias** – All intra-project imports MUST use the `@/` alias (configured to the project root). NEVER prefix an alias import with `@/src`.  Example of a correct import: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';`.
7.  **Required Helper Files** – Your plan MUST include the following files (unless they already exist):
    * `lib/supabase/client.ts`
    * `lib/supabase/server.ts`
    * `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
8.  **File Uploads** – If any feature requires storing images or files (e.g., receipt images) you MUST add steps to implement Supabase Storage upload logic (client component + server action) using `supabase.storage.from().upload()`.
9.  **No Scaffold Files** – DO NOT generate or modify scaffold-level files that already exist in the template such as `package.json`, `tailwind.config.*`, `next.config.*`, `postcss.config.*`, or `tsconfig.json`.  Focus only on feature-specific source files.
10. **Global Stylesheet** – Your plan MUST include creating `app/globals.css` (if it does not already exist) and ensure that the root layout imports it via `import './globals.css';`.
11. **No Custom UI Primitive Generation** – Do **NOT** reference or generate files under `src/components/ui/*`.  Use simple built-in HTML/React elements or existing shared components instead.
