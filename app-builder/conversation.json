I propose we start with two main entities: `User` and `Expense`. \n\nFor `User`, we'd need `id`, `email`, `name`, and `role` (e.g., 'Employee', 'Manager', 'Finance'). \nFor `Expense`, how about `id`, `userId` (linking to the user who submitted it), `amount`, `currency` (defaults to USD), `description`, `dateSubmitted`, `status` (e.g., 'Pending Manager', 'Approved by Manager', 'Rejected by Manager', 'Pending Finance', 'Approved by Finance', 'Rejected by Finance', 'Reimbursed'), and `receiptUrl` (for an uploaded receipt image)? \n\nDoes this initial schema for `User` and `Expense` sound like a good starting point, or would you like to add/modify any fields?",
