# General Quality Rules

- **Production Ready:** All generated code must be production-ready, clean, and free of debugging statements like `console.log`.
- **Iconography:** Use `lucide-react` for all icons.
- **UI Components:** Leverage the existing `shadcn/ui` components for building the user interface whenever applicable. Do not reinvent components that already exist in the library.
- **Comments:** Code should be clear and readable. Add comments only for complex logic that isn't self-explanatory.
