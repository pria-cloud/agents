### Understanding Code Generation

PRIA uses advanced AI to generate production-ready code based on your requirements and conversations.

### Code Generation Process

#### 1. Conversational Input
```
User: "Add a feature to export tasks to PDF"

PRIA: "I'll add PDF export functionality. This will include:
1. A PDF generation service using jsPDF
2. Export button in the task list
3. Custom PDF formatting with company branding
4. Support for filtering exported tasks

Would you like me to include task completion statistics in the PDF?"
```

#### 2. Code Generation
PRIA generates:
- **React Components**: UI components with proper styling
- **API Routes**: Backend logic and database interactions
- **Database Migrations**: Schema changes and updates
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Code comments and API docs

#### 3. Code Review
```typescript
// Generated PDF Export Service
import jsPDF from 'jspdf'
import { Task } from '@/types/task'

export class PDFExportService {
  static async exportTasks(tasks: Task[], options: ExportOptions): Promise<Blob> {
    const doc = new jsPDF()
    
    // Add company header
    doc.setFontSize(20)
    doc.text('Task Export Report', 20, 20)
    
    // Add tasks
    let yPosition = 40
    tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
      doc.setFontSize(12)
      doc.text(`${index + 1}. ${task.title}`, 20, yPosition)
      doc.setFontSize(10)
      doc.text(`Due: ${task.dueDate} | Status: ${task.status}`, 25, yPosition + 5)
      yPosition += 15
    })
    
    return doc.output('blob')
  }
}
```

### Code Quality Standards

All generated code follows strict quality standards:

#### **TypeScript First**

2. Fill in test data:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: SecurePass123!
3. Submit the form
4. Check email for verification link
5. Verify account activation

Let me create a test user for you..."
```

#### 2. Automated Testing
```typescript
// Generated test for user registration
describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should register a new user successfully', async () => {
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'SecurePass123!',
      name: 'Test User'
    }
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/register')
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201)
    
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('user')
    expect(response.body.user.email).toBe(userData.email)
  })
})
```

### Debugging Tools

#### **AI-Powered Debugging**
```
User: "The login form isn't working"

PRIA: "I'll help debug the login issue. Let me check:

1. Form validation logic ‚úì
2. API endpoint connection ‚úó (Error: 500)
3. Database connection ‚úì
4. Authentication service ‚úó (JWT secret missing)

Issue found: Missing JWT_SECRET environment variable.
