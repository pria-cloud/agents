## Test Execution

### Setup Requirements
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Environment Configuration
Created `.env.test` file with test-specific environment variables including:
- Test Supabase configuration
- Test E2B API keys
- Test Claude API keys
- Test GitHub configuration

### Test Scripts Added to package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
    "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed"
  }
}
```

## Key Testing Features

### 1. Browser Context Management
- Persistent storage for session testing
- Clipboard permissions for copy/paste testing
- Realistic viewport sizes

### 2. Error Tracking
- Console error monitoring
- Page error handling
- Network failure simulation

### 3. Visual Testing
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recording for failed tests
- Multiple viewport testing

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Load time measurements
- Network idle detection
- Resource usage tracking

## Test Infrastructure

### Custom Test Runner
Created `run-e2e-tests.js` for coordinated test execution:
- Starts dev server automatically
- Waits for server readiness
- Runs tests with proper cleanup
- Handles process termination gracefully

### Multiple Test Reporters
1. **HTML Reporter**: Interactive test results viewer
2. **JSON Reporter**: Machine-readable test results
3. **JUnit Reporter**: CI/CD integration format
4. **Line Reporter**: Real-time console output

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Port Conflicts**: Tests need to handle dynamic port allocation when default ports are in use
2. **E2B Sandbox Timing**: Some operations with E2B sandboxes may take longer than expected
3. **Authentication State**: Tests need to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated states

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions to run E2E tests on every PR
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add Percy or similar for visual regression testing
3. **Performance Budgets**: Set up performance budgets and monitoring
4. **Accessibility Audits**: Add automated accessibility testing with axe-core

## Conclusion

The comprehensive E2E test suite provides excellent coverage of the PRIA App Builder functionality. With 35+ tests across 13 test suites, the application's critical user flows and edge cases are well-tested. The test infrastructure supports both local development and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring quality throughout the development lifecycle.

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
2. Add performance benchmarking tests
3. Implement visual regression testing
4. Add API contract testing
5. Create load testing scenarios for E2B sandbox management
