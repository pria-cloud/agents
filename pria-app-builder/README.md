# PRIA App Builder

A sophisticated two-app system for building applications with Claude Code AI assistance, following PRIA platform standards. The system uses a split architecture where a Builder App manages the user interface and orchestrates development activities, while Target Apps run in E2B sandboxes with Claude Code SDK for actual code generation.

## Architecture Overview

### Split Architecture Design
- **Builder App** (This Repository): Next.js interface for user interaction, workflow management, and Target App orchestration
- **Target Apps** (E2B Sandboxes): Individual project environments with Claude Code SDK, each developing a specific application

### Key Components
- **7-Phase Structured Workflow**: Requirements â†’ Architecture â†’ Planning â†’ Development â†’ Testing â†’ Validation â†’ Deployment
- **Multi-Tenant Database**: Supabase with Row-Level Security for workspace isolation
- **E2B Sandbox Integration**: Custom template with Node.js 22, Claude Code SDK, Git, and PRIA development environment
- **Requirements Management**: Automatic extraction and lifecycle tracking from Claude conversations
- **Context7 MCP Integration**: Real-time documentation access for all development phases

## Technology Stack

### Builder App
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 19, TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Supabase (database, auth, real-time)
- E2B SDK for sandbox management

### Target Apps (Generated in E2B)
- Next.js 15 (PRIA-compliant)
- Claude Code SDK with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Git integration for version control
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Workflow Phase System
The application implements a sophisticated 7-phase development workflow:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Conversational discovery with automatic requirement extraction
2. **Architecture & Technical Design**: System design with PRIA compliance validation
3. **Implementation Planning**: Task breakdown and dependency mapping
4. **Development & Implementation**: Code generation with iterative refinement
5. **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive testing with automated validation
6. **Final Validation**: Security audit and deployment readiness
7. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Production deployment with continuous monitoring

Each phase includes:
- Phase-specific Claude system prompts with Context7 MCP integration
- Progress tracking and quality gates
- Artifact generation and validation
- Support for iterative, non-linear development

### Multi-Tenancy & Security
- **Workspace Isolation**: Complete data separation using Supabase RLS
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT-based session management
- **API Security**: All endpoints validate workspace access
- **Sandbox Security**: E2B provides isolated development environments

### Documentation Architecture
- **CLAUDE.md** (Builder App): Split architecture context and workflow management
- **CLAUDE.md** (E2B Template): Target app development guidelines and PRIA compliance
- **Target App Specification**: Dynamic requirements and architecture documentation
- **Reference System**: Cross-linked documentation for context preservation

## Development Workflow

### For Builder App Development
1. Work in the `builder-app/` directory
2. Follow Next.js and React best practices
3. Maintain PRIA architectural compliance
4. Update documentation as needed

### For Target App Development
1. Builder App creates E2B sandbox with custom template
2. Claude Code SDK operates within sandbox environment
3. Generated code follows PRIA standards automatically
4. Version control via Git within sandbox
