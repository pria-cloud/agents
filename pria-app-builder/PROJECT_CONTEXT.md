# PRIA App Builder - Project Context & Implementation Status

## Overview
We are building a sophisticated two-app system within an E2B sandbox that enables users to collaboratively build applications with Claude Code AI assistance, following PRIA platform standards. The system has evolved into a production-ready platform with advanced workflow management, requirements tracking, and iterative development support.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Split Architecture (Builder + Target Apps)

   - Real-time chat interface with Claude Code SDK
   - 7-phase structured workflow management
   - Requirements extraction and lifecycle tracking
   - E2B sandbox orchestration and management
   - Multi-tenant workspace isolation

2. **Target Apps** (E2B Sandboxes) - Individual application development environments
   - Each session gets isolated E2B sandbox with custom template
   - Claude Code SDK with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for smooth operations
   - Node.js 22 runtime with Git, GitHub CLI pre-installed
   - Generated code follows PRIA architectural compliance
   - Automatic Git repository management

4. **E2B Sandbox Management**
   - Custom template: `pria-dev-env` with Node.js 22, Claude Code SDK, Git
   - Sandbox persistence across sessions via database tracking
   - Automatic reconnection to existing sandboxes
   - Command execution with proper error handling and logging

5. **Multi-tenant Security Architecture**
