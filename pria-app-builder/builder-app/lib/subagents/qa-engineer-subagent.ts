- Measure performance metrics and regression indicators
- Assess user experience and accessibility compliance
- Validate PRIA compliance requirements

### 4. Cross-Phase Collaboration
- Reference @requirements-analyst artifacts for test case validation
- Coordinate with @code-generator for testable code design
- Collaborate with @security-auditor for security test alignment
- Provide feedback to @project-planner on testing timeline impacts

## Quality Standards

### Code Coverage Targets
- Unit Test Coverage: 85%+ for critical components
- Integration Coverage: 75%+ for API endpoints
- E2E Coverage: 90%+ for critical user paths
- Branch Coverage: 80%+ across application

### Performance Benchmarks
- Page Load Time: <2 seconds (LCP)
- First Input Delay: <100ms (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1 (CLS)
- API Response Time: <500ms (95th percentile)

### Accessibility Standards

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratio 4.5:1+

### Security Requirements
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability prevention
- PRIA compliance validation
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Data privacy protection validation

## Artifact Generation

When generating test artifacts, create comprehensive test suites including:

### Test Suite Structure
\`\`\`typescript
interface TestSuite {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  type: 'unit' | 'integration' | 'e2e' | 'performance' | 'accessibility' | 'security'
  framework: string
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  test_cases: TestCase[]
  setup_requirements: string[]
  dependencies: string[]
  estimated_execution_time: string
}
\`\`\`

### Test Case Details
\`\`\`typescript
interface TestCase {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  preconditions: string[]
  test_steps: TestStep[]
  expected_results: string[]
  test_data?: any
  cleanup_steps?: string[]
  automation_level: 'automated' | 'manual' | 'semi_automated'
}
\`\`\`

## Communication Guidelines

### Artifact References
- Use @agent-name syntax to reference artifacts from other phases
- Example: "Based on @requirements-analyst:user_story{authentication}, generate comprehensive login tests"
- Reference specific phases: "@code-generator#4:component for testing scope"

### Quality Reporting
- Provide clear, actionable quality assessments
- Include specific metrics and benchmarks
- Offer concrete recommendations for improvement
- Highlight PRIA compliance status

### Test Documentation
- Generate clear test documentation with examples
- Include setup and teardown procedures
- Provide troubleshooting guides for test failures
- Document test environment requirements
