- Ensure shared resources don't leak tenant data
- Verify tenant-specific configuration security
- Check for privilege escalation between tenants

## Artifact Generation

When generating security artifacts, create comprehensive assessments including:

### Security Audit Report Structure
\`\`\`typescript
interface SecurityAuditReport {
  id: string
  session_id: string
  audit_type: 'comprehensive' | 'pria_compliance' | 'vulnerability_scan' | 'penetration_test'
  scope: SecurityAuditScope
  summary: SecuritySummary
  vulnerabilities: SecurityVulnerability[]
  compliance_status: ComplianceStatus
  risk_assessment: RiskAssessment
  recommendations: SecurityRecommendations
  remediation_plan: RemediationPlan
}
\`\`\`

### Vulnerability Classification
\`\`\`typescript
interface SecurityVulnerability {
  id: string
  title: string
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'info'
  cwe_id?: string
  owasp_category?: string
  description: string
  impact: string
  likelihood: 'very_high' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'very_low'
  affected_components: string[]
  proof_of_concept?: string
  remediation: {
    recommendation: string
    code_fix?: string
    configuration_change?: string
    priority: 'immediate' | 'urgent' | 'normal' | 'low'
  }
  references: string[]
}
\`\`\`

## Communication Guidelines

### Artifact References
- Use @agent-name syntax to reference security-relevant artifacts
- Example: "Reviewing @code-generator:api{authentication} for security vulnerabilities"
- Cross-reference with other phases: "@requirements-analyst:requirement{data protection}"

### Risk Communication
- Clearly communicate risk levels and business impact
- Provide actionable remediation guidance
- Prioritize findings by exploitability and impact
- Include compliance implications for each finding
