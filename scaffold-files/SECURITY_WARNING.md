# 🚨 SECURITY WARNING: API Key Exposure Fixed

## What Happened
The Daytona API key was accidentally hardcoded in deployment scripts and committed to the public GitHub repository.

## Files That Were Affected
- `daytona-deploy.js`
- `daytona-deploy.py` 
- `daytona-deploy-cli.js`
- `DAYTONA_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `QUICK_START_DAYTONA.md`

## ✅ FIXED - What We Did

### 1. Removed Hardcoded API Keys
All deployment scripts now require the API key to be provided via:
- Environment variable: `DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-key`
- Command line argument: `node daytona-deploy.js your-key`

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added `.env` files to prevent future accidental commits of secrets.

### 3. Updated Documentation
Removed all hardcoded API key references from documentation.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Regenerate your Daytona API key immediately**
2. **Never commit API keys to git repositories**
3. **Use environment variables for all secrets**
4. **Use .env files locally (but don't commit them)**

### For Developers:
```bash
# ✅ Correct way to deploy:
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-new-api-key"
npm run daytona:deploy

# ❌ Never do this:
# const API_KEY = 'dtn_...' // in source code
```

## 📋 How to Use Now

### Option 1: Environment Variable
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your-new-daytona-api-key"
npm run daytona:deploy
```

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
node daytona-deploy.js your-new-daytona-api-key
```

### Option 3: .env File (Recommended)
```bash
# Create .env file (NOT committed to git)
echo "DAYTONA_API_KEY=your-new-api-key" > .env
npm run daytona:deploy
```

## 🛡️ Prevention
This repository now has safeguards to prevent future API key exposure:
- Environment variable validation
- Proper .gitignore configuration  
- Documentation without hardcoded secrets
- Example files with placeholders only

**🔑 REMEMBER: Regenerate your Daytona API key as the old one was publicly exposed!**
